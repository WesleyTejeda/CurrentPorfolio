# CurrentPorfolio
In this repository I created a main page with information about myself and 2 subpages.
Using only bootstrap CSS (and just a touch of inline CSS) I created responsive webpages 
coupled with responsive images. This was done without the use of web queries.

![](final_results/lgIndex.png?raw=true "Large Index")

In the folder titled final results you will see that our index.html has 3 states when in different screen sizes.
Each page was modified with the same responsive layout so I'll discuss index. In the large screen our card only takes up
about half of the page with margins to the left. When the screen size goes to a medium size the card will take up the full
row length in our container. When the screen goes to small size our card will retain the size but out navbar will shift below my name as well as our image become larger as it will take up the full row width. 

Each page also has a sticky footer that scrolls with the page.

If you'd like to see more please open the web pages included in this folder or go to my page at wesleytejeda.github.io/CurrentPortfolio

Thank you.
